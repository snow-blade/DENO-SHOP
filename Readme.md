# DENO-SHOP
### A simple rest api for a lambda general shop

### Description
I made this project in that simulate a general store and in my spare time so that i can get a better understanding of deno and ts;<br>
To run this on a local server first install deno with:<br>
`$ curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh`<br>
Then verify you installation with:<br>
 `$ deno --version`<br>
After cloning his repo through ssh or http, cd into it and type:<br>
`$ deno run --allow-net server.ts`<br>
<br>
That should be it, and you should see this:
```
$ deno run --allow-net server.ts
Compile file:///home/free/deno_rest/server.ts
Server running on port 8000

```
